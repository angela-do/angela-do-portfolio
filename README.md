# Project Creation
(1) On my terminal window, I first installed react by running the following:
	npm install create-react-app
(2) I then created my project by running the following:
	npx create-react-app {PROJECT_NAME}
	In this case, the project name is 'angela-do-portfolio'

# Navigating Through File Structure
- In the 'public' folder, I linked a couple different stylesheets.
	- Fonts and icons from Google's API
	- Animations and icons from Cloudflare
- All of my changed code for my website will be found in the folder 'src'
	'angela-do-portfolio' --> 'src'
- App.js & App.css
	- 'App.js' is my main code for my app
	- 'App.css' contains the over-arching css-styling for the whole app
- The folder 'components' contains all of my components for the website. These include the following:
	- About (a little description about myself)
	- Contact (how my portfolio visitors can connect with me)
	- Intro (a little bit about myself)
	- Menu (navigation through the website)
	- Work (some projects I have done or am in the process of completing)
- Each component folder contains a .jsx file and a .css file
	- My 'work' component folder contains each project as their own component
		- I currently put up three projects.
		- I found this better because I could just update the work component easily without having a lot of code in it.

# Requirements (9/12)
** Some requirements I left off because I found them to be aligned with the way that I wanted my page to be designed. **
(1/1) Make the page scrollable all the way through the different pages on my portfolio.
(1/1) Provide nice transitions when scrolling into a different part of the portfolio.
(1/1) Provide more animations and or fun features throughout the website to make my portfolio more personable.
(0/1) Create all of my own buttons, cursors, animations, and more.
	- Reason for omitting: Decided to gather them from Google's API instead.
(1/1) Create a form that people can fill out so they can contact me.
(1/1) Have a dynamic navigation bar that changes to a hamburger menu when the screen is a certain size.
(0/1) Flesh out my hobbies section more.
	- Reason for omitting: Decided that I wanted my 'About' section to be short and sweet.
	- I think in the near future I'll add more pages so that I can expand this section in detail.
	- Otherwise, it's a bit too much for the way that my page is designed.
(0/1) I want to either embed my Instagram photography account into the area, or create a cool slideshow for people to see my work.
	- Reason for omitting: Same as above.
(1/1) Display my resume and allow employers to download my resume.
(1/1) Deploy the website so that it is live on the Internet.
(1/1) Have all my projects listed from my UCI career.
